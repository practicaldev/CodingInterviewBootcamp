Coin Change: Given a target amount and a set of coin denominations, find
the minimum number of coins required to make up the target amount.

Activity Selection: Given a list of activities with their start and end
times, find the maximum number of activities that can be performed
without overlapping.

Interval Scheduling: Given a set of intervals, find the maximum number
of non-overlapping intervals that can be selected.

Fractional Knapsack: Given a set of items with their weights and values,
determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a fraction
of each item to fit in a knapsack with a limited weight capacity.

Minimum Spanning Tree: Given a connected, undirected graph, find a
spanning tree with the minimum total weight.

Huffman Coding: Given a set of characters and their frequencies,
construct an optimal prefix-free binary code such that the total encoded
length is minimized.

Job Sequencing with Deadlines: Given a set of jobs with their deadlines
and profits, find the maximum profit that can be obtained by scheduling
the jobs within their deadlines.

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Given a weighted graph and a source vertex, find
the shortest paths from the source vertex to all other vertices.

Prim's Algorithm: Given a connected, undirected graph with weighted
edges, find a minimum spanning tree starting from an arbitrary vertex.

Gas Station: Given an array of gas stations with their respective gas
amounts and distances between them, find the starting gas station from
which you can travel around the circuit once without running out of gas.
