Breadth-First Search (BFS): Implement BFS traversal on a graph, starting
from a given source vertex and visiting all its neighboring vertices.

Depth-First Search (DFS): Implement DFS traversal on a graph, starting
from a given source vertex and exploring as far as possible along each
branch before backtracking.

Graph Valid Tree: Given an undirected graph, determine if it is a valid
tree.

Course Schedule: Given the total number of courses and a list of
prerequisite pairs, determine if it is possible to finish all courses.

Clone Graph: Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected
graph, clone the graph.

Word Ladder: Given two words (beginWord and endWord) and a dictionary of
words, find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from
beginWord to endWord.

Number of Islands: Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water),
count the number of islands.

Graph Connectivity: Determine the number of connected components in an
undirected graph.

Alien Dictionary: Given a list of words in an alien language sorted
lexicographically, determine the order of the characters in the alien
language.

Network Delay Time: There are N network nodes, labeled from 1 to N.
Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges, and K, a starting
node, calculate the time it takes for all nodes to receive the signal
from the starting node.
