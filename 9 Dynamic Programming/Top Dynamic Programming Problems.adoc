programming techniques.

Climbing Stairs: Given a staircase with n steps, determine the number of
distinct ways to reach the top by either climbing 1 or 2 steps at a
time.

Longest Increasing Subsequence: Find the length of the longest
subsequence in an array that is in increasing order.

Knapsack Problem: Given a set of items with weights and values,
determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset
of items with a total weight not exceeding a given limit.

Coin Change: Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find
the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.

Longest Common Subsequence: Find the length of the longest subsequence
that is common to two given strings.

Maximum Subarray Sum: Find the contiguous subarray within an array that
has the largest sum.

Edit Distance: Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations
(insertions, deletions, and substitutions) required to transform one
string into the other.

Rod Cutting: Given a rod of length n and a price list for different
lengths, determine the maximum value that can be obtained by cutting the
rod into smaller pieces and selling them.
