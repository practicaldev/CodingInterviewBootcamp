== Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to prepare for a coding interview
for the positions of the developer, senior developer, or architect. You
will create a checklist of steps to follow, develop a list of questions
to ask when faced with a problem and identify top solutions for common
interview problems.

Instructions:

=== Checklist for Interview Preparation:

* Understand the job requirements and expectations.
* Review technical concepts, data structures, algorithms, and design
patterns.

* Study system design principles, scalability concepts, and distributed
systems.
* Schedule mock interviews to simulate real interview scenarios.
* Review and showcase your past work, highlighting achievements and
problem-solving skills.
* Stay updated with the latest industry trends, technologies, and
frameworks.

=== Questions to Ask for a Problem:

* Choose a problem related to the desired position (developer, senior
developer, or architect) and create a list of questions to ask when
faced with that problem. Consider aspects such as edge cases,
performance optimization, scalability, and trade-offs in design.

=== Top Solutions for Common Interview Problems:

* Research and identify the top solutions for the following common
interview problems:
* Binary Search Tree (BST) operations (insertion, deletion, search,
etc.).
* Merge Sort or Quick Sort implementation.
* Finding the longest common substring between two strings.
* Designing a scalable distributed system architecture.
* Implementing a priority queue or heap data structure.

balancing, caching, sharding, and database design.
** Study common architectural patterns like microservices, event-driven
architecture, and distributed systems.
** Familiarize yourself with technologies used in scalable systems, such
as message queues, caching systems, and distributed databases.
* Schedule Mock Interviews:
** Find a study partner or join a coding interview preparation group to
conduct mock interviews.
** Simulate real interview scenarios by solving problems and explaining
your thought process aloud.
** Seek feedback on your problem-solving approach, coding style, and
communication skills.
* Showcase Past Work and Achievements:
** Prepare to discuss your past projects, highlighting any significant
challenges, solutions, and outcomes.
** Emphasize your *problem-solving skills*, ability to work in a team,
and any leadership or mentorship experiences.

practices, code quality, and testing.
* Stay Updated with Industry Trends:
** Follow industry blogs, forums, and social media channels to stay
informed about the latest trends, technologies, and frameworks.
** Keep up-to-date with advancements in programming languages,
libraries, and tools relevant to the position you are applying for.
** Stay informed about current topics in software engineering, such as
cloud computing, machine learning, and cybersecurity.

Remember, interview preparation is an ongoing process. Dedicate regular
time to practice coding problems, review concepts, and stay updated with
industry trends to ensure you are well-prepared for your coding
interview.

=== Questions to Ask for a Problem

When approaching a problem during a coding interview, it's essential to
ask clarifying questions to fully understand the problem and gather any
additional information that may help find a solution. Here are some key
questions to ask:

* Input and Output:
** What is the input format? Is it a single value, a list, or a data
structure like a tree or graph?
** What is the expected output format? Does it need to be returned as a
specific data structure or in a particular order?
** Are there any constraints on the input, such as size limits or
allowed data types?
* Problem Constraints:
** Are there any specific runtime or space complexity requirements?
** Is the input always valid and within certain bounds?
** Are there any edge cases or special scenarios that need to be
handled?
* Problem Clarification:
** Can you provide an example input and its corresponding expected
output?
** Are there any specific rules or constraints related to the problem
domain?
** Can the input contain duplicates, and if so, how should they be
handled?
** Are there any specific data structures or algorithms that should be
utilized or avoided?
* Problem Scope and Extensibility:
** Is this a standalone problem, or does it have any relation to a
larger system or domain?
** Are there any potential future enhancements or considerations that
should be considered?
* Test Cases and Validations:
** What kind of test cases should the solution cover?
** Are there any specific edge cases or tricky scenarios that should be
tested?
** How should the solution handle invalid or unexpected input?
* Time and Space Complexity Considerations:
** Are there any performance requirements that need to be optimized?
** Are there any limitations on memory usage or any specific space
complexity requirements?

Remember, asking these questions not only helps you clarify the problem
but also demonstrates your problem-solving approach and communication
skills to the interviewer.
