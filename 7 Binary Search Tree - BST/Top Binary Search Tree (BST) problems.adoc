Validate Binary Search Tree: Given a binary tree, determine if it is a
valid binary search tree.

Binary Tree Inorder Traversal: Given a binary tree, return the inorder
traversal of its nodes' values.

Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree: Given an array of integers
sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search
tree.

Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree: Given a binary search
tree and two nodes, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two
nodes in the BST.

Kth Smallest Element in a BST: Given a binary search tree, find the kth
smallest element in it.

Range Sum of BST: Given the root node of a binary search tree, return
the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the range [low, high].

Delete Node in a BST: Given a root node reference of a BST and a key,
delete the node with the given key from the BST and return the root of
the modified BST.

Convert BST to Greater Tree: Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert
it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed
to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original
key in BST.

Inorder Successor in BST: Given a binary search tree and a node in it,
find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

Recover Binary Search Tree: Two elements of a binary search tree (BST)
are swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.
